# StealthOrbiter
Stealthburner Orbiter V2.0 mount, with can bus toolhead support.

# Description
This mod aims to mount the orbiter V2.0 extruder to the stealthburner assembly. In addition, it incorporates the Orbiter filament sensor to enable support for the ERCF.

In addition, it also includes a canbus toolhead mount (EBB36 or SHT-36 board). If you would instead prefer to use a cable chain, spacelab_2021 has developed a cable chain mount that attaches to the back of the orbiter motor here: https://www.teamfdm.com/files/file/485-orbiter-2-clockwork-beta/
