# StealthOrbiter
This mod aims to mount the orbiter V2.0 extruder to the stealthburner & [crowncooler](https://github.com/sneakytreesnake/CrownCooler) assembly. 

# Features
- It is fully compatible with the rest of the stealthburner system of hot ends & shrouds. A slightly modified (and optional!) version of the stealthburner fan shroud has been included to allow access to the orbiter filament lever.
- Compatible with the [Crown Cooler system.](https://github.com/sneakytreesnake/CrownCooler)
- Has a straight filament path. 
- Has an integrated filament sensor beneath the extruder.
- Supports ERCF.
- Works with cable chains or canbus boards via compatible community mods.
- Hinge section to allow support for a hinged shroud.

# Development Roadmap
1) [COMPLETE] Initial release!

2) [COMPELTE] Add ERCF filament sensor

3) If there is sufficient demand, I will design a shroud that aesthetically covers the extruder. A hinge has already been designed into the mount in anticipation. 


# Installation
1) Print orbiter mount. Though optional, I recommend printing the stealthburner fanshroud.
2) Decide wiring method. Print associated parts

[Canbus Boards](https://github.com/KayosMaker/CANboard_Mounts)

[Cable Chain](https://www.teamfdm.com/files/file/485-orbiter-2-clockwork-beta/)

3) If you are using the filament sensor feature, add 5mm ball bearing and install Omron D2FL endstop switch using self tapping screws. The ball bearing should drop freely into the hole with no friction. Wire this switch as a standard filament switch.
