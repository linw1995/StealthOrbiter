# StealthOrbiter
This mod aims to mount the orbiter V2.0 extruder to the stealthburner assembly. In addition, it incorporates the Orbiter filament sensor to enable support for the ERCF. The ERCF scripts have been (crudely!) modified to work with the toolhead sensor mounted before the extruder gears.

In addition, it also ~~includes a canbus toolhead mount (BTT EBB36 board for now)~~. This design is obsolete as it cannot be used for input-shaper. Instead use other designs created by the community such as [here.](https://github.com/KayosMaker/CANboard_Mounts)

If you would instead prefer to use a cable chain, spacelab_2021 has developed a cable chain mount that attaches to the back of the orbiter motor here: https://www.teamfdm.com/files/file/485-orbiter-2-clockwork-beta/

# Development Roadmap
1)[COMPLETE] Initial release!

2)Add cable shroud.

3)Incorporate fan into cable shroud (cooling canbus toolhead stepper).

4)Design version of orbiter mount with cable chain attachment.


# Installation
Instructions coming soon?
